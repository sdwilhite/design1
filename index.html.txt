<h1>Manifesto</h1>

<hr>

<p> <img src="flowers_001.jpg">
My process starts by looking for inspiration. I usually get my ideas from Pinterest, nature, or a simple doodle. Sometimes my ideas are clear detailed and sometimes they’re just a jumbled mess. Sometimes I don’t have an idea at all, which can be very frustrating. But eventually, an idea will come to me that I can run with. Once I have a grasp on what I’m doing, I sketch. Usually, there are several drafts before I get to one that I’m satisfied with, but once I’ve got a clear sketch, I can move it over to Illustrator or Photoshop depending on the project. This part can take quite a while, as I never seem to be satisfied until I’ve done and redone certain aspects of my design several times. Now, I am a person who depends on motivation to get things done, so it’s easy for me to simply lose motivation in projects I’m working on. It can be hard to finish out a project with the speed and motivation with which I started it. When this happens I tried to remind myself of the excitement of my initial ideas and how I imagine it turning out, and this can help to put me back on track with the project. As much as I would like to say that I’m always satisfied with the outcome of my projects, that is simply not true. I would say that it is probably not true for any artist, especially one who is frequently producing new art. Sometimes I get done with a project and I never want to see it again. Other times I finish a piece and I want to hang it up in every room of my house. The reality of it is that not every project will be a masterpiece, and that is a universal challenge that every artist faces.

My experience with design is brief, but I have found this thing to be universally true: design is perspective. Not only the perspective of one’s self but the perspectives of a whole world of other designers. Designers who live different lives and have a different view of the world than you do. Design allows us to walk in the footsteps of a stranger, someone who looks and talks and thinks differently than you. It allows us to see into the mind of someone who we may not ever speak to, but who will speak to us through their work.
